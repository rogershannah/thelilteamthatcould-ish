  <div>
    <h1 id="postmortem">Post Mortem</h1> <p>We believe we did a good job on creating a separation of responsibilities within the game engine itself, such as having components for major object functions. However, in the future we could create a transform component for the GameObject's position and velocity. We had trouble doing this as the GameObject's transform attributes were used by so many other components.</p>
    <p>Another improvement we could make is on general graphics and feedback. We used 2D bitmaps for our demo that could be customized in the GUI. A good improvement would be to use 3D graphics in a 2D plane, or add particle effects on collisions. For audio, we could add customizable audio for events in the game.</p>
    <p> If given another month on this project, our team had many plans that we wish we could have implemented but had to scale back due to unexpected obstacles. For example, we had started building out a 3D graphics engine with a custom renderer to create a 2.5D game. With more time, (and Hannah concussion-free) we believe that this could have been implemented. We also hoped to implement a more fleshed out physics engine - adding more sophisticated collisions, gravitational effects, and rigid-body dynamic would allow us to modify the Asteroids base in interesting ways. Additionally, we had plans for the 3D space background to be customizable via our GUI. Expanding the GUI capabilities overall would be another thing our team would love to expand on our project. Even given a few more days, we would have loved making the game more customizable.</p>
    <p> Lastly, we would have liked to have had a more leisurely time wrapping up and presenting our work. We were still working on features and bug-fixes up to the last day, which gave us minimal time to clean up code style and add more thoughtful comments. If we had completed a more robust and bug-free build earlier, we would have devoted more time to thorough and comprehensive documentation, as well as presentation of our work.</p>
